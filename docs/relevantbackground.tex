\section{Relevant Background}

\subsection{Agda Introduction}
Agda is a dependently typed functional language developed by Norell at the Chalmers University of Technology
as his Ph.D. Thesis.
The current version of Agda is Agda 2.

  \subsubsection{Syntax}
  In Agda, \emph{Set} is equal to type.
  In languages with dependent types, it is possible to create a function that returns a type.

  \agda{agdaExamples}{funcType}

  After the function name, it is two colons (\emph{:}) and the arguments of the function.
  It is closed by \emph{(name\_of\_argument : type\_of\_argument)}.
  After all, there is one arrow and the type of the result of the function.
  This ``if, then, else'' is not a function built-in in Agda.
  It is a function defined this way \emph{if\_then\_else\_} .

  So it is possible to use this function in the default way.

  \agda{agdaExamples}{funcTypeUnd}

  Or use the arguments inside the underscore.

  \agda{agdaExamples}{funcType2}

  The same notation can be done using just arrows without naming the arguments.

  Because of dependent types, it is possible to have a type that depends on the input.

  \agda{agdaExamples}{dependentType}

  It is possible in Agda to do the pattern match.
  So it breaks the input in cases.

  \agda{agdaExamples}{patternMatch}

  To create a new type with a different pattern match, it is used the data constructor.

  \agda{agdaExamples}{dataConstructor}

  This is another example of \emph{Data Set}, but it depends on the argument.

  \agda{agdaExamples}{vector}

  \emph{Vector zero} is a type of a vector of size zero, so the only option to construct it is the empty vector.
  It is constructed from the first constructor.
  Other types of vectors like \emph{Vector 1} (vector of size one), \emph{Vector 2}, ... can only be constructed by
  the second constructor.
  It takes as argument a natural number and a vector and returns a vector with the size of the last vector
  plus one.

  Records are data types with just one case of pattern match.

  \agda{agdaExamples}{record}

  The constructor is the name of the data constructor.

  \hyperref[id]{Implicit terms} are elements that the compiler is smart enough to deduce it.
  So it is not necessary to put it as an argument of the function.

  \plabel{id}
  \agda{agdaExamples}{id}

  Implicit arguments are inside \emph{\{\}}.
  In this example, the name of the Set (\emph{A}) can not be omitted
  (like the second function version of boolean to set),
  because it is used to say that \emph{x} is of type \emph{A}.

  In the case of the function \emph{id}, the type of input can be deduced by the compiler.
  For example, \emph{id} function should be a function from Natural to Natural because
  \emph{zeroN} is already of type Natural.
  In this example, the compiler could figure out the term \emph{A} (Natural) of type \emph{Set}.

  \agda{agdaExamples}{idNat}

  Functions in Agda can be defined in two ways

  \agda{agdaExamples}{funcs}

  In the first case, the arguments are before equal sign (\emph{=}).
  In the second case, it is used the lambda abstraction that means the same thing.

  \agda{agdaExamples}{caseOf}

  \agda{agdaExamples}{filter}

  Filter is a function that filters all elements that have some property already defined.
  In this definition of filter, the lambda abstraction can pattern match
  in the two possibilities of \emph{p x}, that are \emph{true} or \emph{false}

  \agda{agdaExamples}{filterWith}

  The \emph{with} abstraction is the same thing as the \emph{case of}.
  Before the \emph{=}, there are the possibilities of \emph{p x} (\emph{true} or \emph{false}).

  \agda{agdaExamples}{postulate}

  In Agda, the \emph{postulate} assumes that there is one element of a given type without defining it.
  In this example, \emph{someBot} is an element of the empty type.
  Postulate can be dangerous because it assumes that some element of a given type exists,
  but it can not (like in the example).

  \agda{agdaExamples}{rewrite}

  In Agda, \emph{rewrite} means changing the returned type of the result.
  Because $a + b ≡ b + a$, returning an element of the type $P (a + b)$ is the
  same thing that returning an element of the type $P (b + a)$.

  \subsubsection{Lambda Calculus}
  Lambda Calculus is a minimalist Turing complete programming language with the concept of abstraction,
  application using binding and substitution. For example, \emph{x} is a variable, $(\lambda x.M)$
  is an Abstraction and (\emph{M N}) is an Application.

  In Lambda Calculus, there are two types of computational conversions $\alpha$-conversion
  and $\beta$-reduction.
  In $\alpha$-conversion, $(\lambda x.M[x]) \rightarrow (\lambda y.M[y])$.
  So in every free variable \emph{x} in \emph{M} will be renamed to \emph{y}.
  For \emph{M[x] = x}, an $\alpha$-conversion is $(\lambda x.x) \rightarrow (\lambda y.y)$

  A free variable is every variable that is not bound outside.
  For example, $((\lambda\textcolor{green}{x}.\textcolor{blue}{x}) \textcolor{red}{x})$.
  The \textcolor{blue}{blue x} is bonded for the \textcolor{green}{green x},
  but the \textcolor{red}{red x}
  is not bonded for any function. So the \textcolor{red}{red x} is a free variable.

  In $\beta$-reduction, it replaces the all free for the expression in the application.
  The $\beta$-reduction of this expression $((\lambda x.M) N) \rightarrow (M[x := N])$ .
  So if $M = x$, the $\beta$-reduction will be $((\lambda x.x) N) \rightarrow N$.
  If $M = (\lambda x.x) x$, the $\beta$-reduction will be
  $(\lambda x.((\lambda x.x)x))N \rightarrow (\lambda x.x)N$.

  Agda uses typed lambda calculus.
  So in an application \emph{(M N)}, \emph{M} has to be of type $A \Rightarrow B$ and N has to be of type A.
  $(\lambda (x : A) . x)$ is of type $A \Rightarrow A$, because \emph{x} is of type \emph{A}.

  \agda{lambdaCalculus}{Id}
  The simplest function is the identity function made in Agda.

  \plabel{id2}
  \agda{lambdaCalculus}{Id2}
  \hyperref[id2]{This} is another way of writing the same function.

  \plabel{truefalse}
  \agda{lambdaCalculus}{trueFalse}
  \hyperref[truefalse]{This} is how true and false are encoded in lambda calculus.

  \plabel{naturals}
  \agda{lambdaCalculus}{naturals}
  \hyperref[naturals]{This} is how naturals numbers are defined in lambda calculus.
  Look that the definition of zero looks like the definition of false.

  \agda{lambdaCalculus}{isZero}
  Defining natural numbers in this way, it is possible to say if a natural number is zero or not.

  \agda{lambdaCalculus}{plus}
  Plus is defined this way using lambda calculus.

  \plabel{onepone}
  \agda{lambdaCalculus}{onePone}
  \hyperref[onepone]{This} is one example of the calculation of one plus one in Lambda Calculus.

  \plabel{list}
  \agda{lambdaCalculus}{list}
  \hyperref[list]{This} is how lists are defined in Lambda Calculus.

  \agda{lambdaCalculus}{sumList}
  Substituting the cons operation of list per plus and nil list to zero, it is possible to calculate
  the sum of the list.

  \agda{lambdaCalculus}{either}
  In this way, it is possible to define \emph{Either}.
  It is one way to create a type that can be a Natural or a Boolean.

  \agda{lambdaCalculus}{eitherExamples}
  In these examples, it is defined zero, one in left and false, true in right.

  \agda{lambdaCalculus}{eitherRes}
  \emph{Either} is useful when defining one function that works for left and another that works for the right.
  If the natural number is zero, the function chosen is the left and
  if it is an identity, the function chosen is the right. 

  \plabel{tuple}
  \agda{lambdaCalculus}{tuple}
  \hyperref[tuple]{This way} is how tuple is defined in Lambda Calculus.

  \plabel{tupleexamples}
  \agda{lambdaCalculus}{tupleExamples}
  \hyperref[tupleexamples]{This} is how is defined the tuple zero false and the tuple one true.

  \plabel{tupleadd}
  \agda{lambdaCalculus}{tupleAdd}
  \hyperref[tupleadd]{This} is one way of defining a function that adds one to the argument
  if the first element of the tuple is true.


  \subsubsection{Martin-Löf type theory}
  Agda also provides proof assistants based on the intentional Martin-Löf type theory.

    In Martin-Löf type theory, there are three finite types and five constructors types.
    The zero type contains zero terms. It is called the empty type and it is written $\bot$.
    \agda{agdaExamples}{botType}

    The first type is the type with just one canonical term and it represents existence.
    It is called unit type and it is written top.
    \agda{agdaExamples}{trivialType}

    The second type contains two canonical terms. It represents a choice between two values.
    \agda{agdaExamples}{eitherType}

    The Boolean type is defined using the Trivial type and the Either type.
    \agda{agdaExamples}{boolType}

    If statement is defined using booleans.
    \agda{agdaExamples}{ifThenElse}


    \subsubsection{Types Constructors}
    The product-types contain an ordered pair.
    The second type can depend on the first type.
    \agda{agdaExamples}{mulType}

    \agda{agdaExamples}{mulEx}
    In the function $\exists-vec$, the product-type has the same meaning of exists.
    This type means that
    ``Exists a natural number \emph{n} that there is one element of type \emph{Vector A n}''

    The $\pi$-types contain functions.
    So given an input type, it will return an output type.
    It has the same meaning as a function:
    \agda{agdaExamples}{piType}

    In Inductive types, it is a self-referential type.
    Naturals numbers are examples of that:
    \agda{agdaExamples}{Nat}
    Other data structures like a linked list of natural numbers, trees, graphs are inductive types too.

    Proofs in inductive types are made by induction.
    \agda{agdaExamples}{NatElim}

    Universe types are created to allow proofs written in all types.
    For example, the type of \emph{Nat} is \emph{U0}.


Agda has dependent types like in CoQ but does not have tactics.
Agda is a total language, so it is guaranteed that the code always finish
(impossible infinite loops) and coverage all inputs.

Agda has inductive data types that are similar to algebraic data types in non-dependently
typed programming languages.
The definition of Peano numbers in Agda is:

\agda{agdaExamples}{Nat}

Definitions in Agda are done using induction.
For example, the sum of two numbers in Agda:

\agda{agdaExamples}{sum}

In Agda, because of dependent types, it is possible to make more expressive types that are not
possible in other languages.
For example, get the first element of a vector.
For it, it is necessary to specify in the type that the vector should have a size greater than zero.

\agda{agdaExamples}{vecHead}

Another good example is that in the sum of two matrices, they should have the same dimensions.

\agda{agdaExamples}{matrixSum}

\subsubsection{Preposition as Types}

In Agda, types can be seen as prepositions and terms of this given type like a proof.
For example, \emph{x} can be a term of the type \emph{A}.
So \emph{x} is a proof that \emph{A} holds.

\agda{agdaExamples}{id}

In the function \emph{id},
if there is a proof \emph{x} that \emph{A} holds,
so \emph{A} holds.
The function \emph{id} is a proof of $A \rightarrow A$.

\agda{agdaExamples}{and}

In the function \emph{and}, \emph{a} is a proof that \emph{A} holds and
\emph{b} is a proof that \emph{B} holds,
so \emph{a , b} is a proof of $A \times B$

\agda{agdaExamples}{equality}

Equality function can be seen as
``For all elements of \emph{x} in the Set \emph{A}, $x \equiv x$''.
If there is a term of this type, so this preposition is true.
In this case, the term is a function that given a term \emph{x} of type \emph{A},
it returns \emph{refl \{\_\} \{\_\} \{x\}}.
\emph{refl} is a constructor of equality, so \emph{refl \{\_\} \{\_\} \{x\}}
returns a term of type $x \equiv x$.

\subsection{Bitcoin Overview}

The Bitcoin was made to be a peer to peer electronic cash.
It was made in one way that users can save and verify transactions without the need of a trusted party.
Because of that no authority or government can shut down the Bitcoin.

\incimg{transactions1}{png}{Transaction}
%% https://medium.com/coinmonks/bitcoin-transactions-be401b48afe6

Transactions in Bitcoins (like in \figref{transactions1}) are an array of input of
previous transactions and an array of outputs.
Each input and output is an address, each address is made from a public key
that is made from a private key.

\incimg{privatekey}{png}{Bitcoin account}
%% https://coinsutra.com/bitcoin-private-key/

A private key is a big number.
It is so big that it is almost impossible to generate two identical private keys.

The public key is generated from the private key
(like in \figref{privatekey} where the account number is f(p)),
but a private key can not be generated from a public key.

In Bitcoin, the miner is someone that calculates a value \emph{nounce} for each block.
Because of that, he receives all transaction fees of this block plus a block reward.
The mining transaction (made for the miner) does require an input.
For each input transaction, it is necessary a signature signed with a private key
(like in \figref{privatekey} where the signature is f(p,t))
to prove the ownership of the Bitcoins.
With the message and the signature, it is possible to know that the owner of the private key
that generates the public key signed the message.

Signature is created from a function that receives as inputs the private key and the message.
There is no analytical form of the inverse of this function.
Because of that, the only way of finding an element \emph{x} that this function \emph{f} so
that $f(x) = y$ for a given \emph{y} is trying for random different values of \emph{x}.
So it is almost impossible to find the private key from a message, a signature, and the public key.
In \figref{privatekey}, the checker is a f(t,s,a).
So because of that, the owner of the private key can sign several messages without anyone knows
his private key.

\incimg{transactions2}{jpg}{Verification and signature of transactions}
%% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network

Transactions (shown in \figref{transactions2}) are grouped in a block (shown in \figref{blockchain}).
Each block contains in its header the timestamp of its creation, the hash of the block,
the previous hash and a nonce.
A nonce is an arbitrary value that the miner has to choose to make the hash of the block respect some
specific characteristics.

\incimg{blockchain}{png}{Blockchain}
%% https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/12427/can-someone-explain-how-the-bitcoin-blockchain-works/13347
%% https://i.stack.imgur.com/HrKX0.png

Each block has a size limit of 1 MB.
Because of that, Bitcoin forms a blockchain (a chain of blocks).
Each block should be created at an average of 10 minutes.
The advantage of using a short average time of block creation is that it will propagate transactions
faster in the blockchain.
But the disadvantage is that it increases the probability of creating orphan blocks.
To make the blockchain tamper-proof (nobody can alter an existing block),
there is a concept called proof of work in Bitcoin.
To create a new block, the creator (called the miner) has to choose a random value as nonce that makes
the hash of the block less than a certain value.
This value is chosen in a way that each block should be generated on 10 minutes on average.
If the value is for example 100 and the total possibilities of results are 10.000 (codomain),
the probability of finding \emph{x} so that $hash(x) \leqslant 100$ is 1\% $100/10.000$.
Because of that, in this example, the miner has to calculate on average 100 hashes before finding
the right one.

If the value is too low, miners will take more time to find a nonce that makes the hash block
less than it.
If it is too high, it will be easier to find a nonce and they will find it faster.

When two different blocks are created in nearly the same time, there are two valid blockchains.
It is because the last block in both blockchains are valid but different.
Because of this problem, in the Bitcoin protocol, the largest chain is always the right chain.
While two valid chains have the same size, it is not possible to know which chain is the right.
This situation is called fork and when it happens, it is necessary to wait to see in which chain
the new block will be.

If miners have more than 50\% of the hash rates of Bitcoin, they can do an attack called a
51\% attack.
It happens when some miner, with more power than all network, mine secretly the blocks.
So if the main network has 50 blocks, the miner could produce hidden blocks from 46 to 55
and he would have 10 hidden blocks from the network.
When he shows their hidden blocks, his chain becomes the valid chain, because it is bigger.
So all transactions from the previous blockchain from 46 to 50 blocks become invalid.
Because of that, when someone makes a big transaction in the blockchain, it is a good idea
to wait more time.
So it is becoming harder and harder to make a 51\% with more time.
Bitcoin has the highest market value nowadays, so attacking the Bitcoin network is very expensive.
Nowadays, this kind of attack is more common in new altcoins.

Ledger is a software that tracks how much money each address can spend.
It can be known when calculating the sum amount of all unspent output transactions destined
for each address.

The \gls{utxo} model used in Bitcoin and the account model used in Ethereum are the two most used kinds
of data structures to model account records and savings states.

In the account model, it is saved the address and the balance of each address.
For example, the data structure will look like this [(0xabc01, 1.01), (0xabc02, 2.02)].
So the address 0xabc01 has 1.01a of balance and the address 0xabc02 has 2.02 of balance.
In this way, it is possible to easily know how much balance each address has,
but it is not possible to know how they got in this state.

  \incimg{utxo}{png}{UTXO transactions}
  %% https://bitcoin.org/
  %% https://medium.com/@sunflora98/utxo-vs-account-balance-model-5e6470f4e0cf

In the \gls{utxo} model (shown in \figref{utxo}), each transaction is saved in the transaction tree.
Every transaction is composed of multiples inputs and multiples outputs.
But all inputs have to come from outputs that have never been spent before.

Because of that, in the \gls{utxo} model, it is easy to make a new transaction from the previous one,
but it is harder to know how much each one has.
To know how much someone has, it is necessary to calculate the sum of all unspent transaction outputs
destined for his addresses.

In the account model, there could be one kind of vulnerability
that is less probable to happen in the \gls{utxo} model.
Changing both addresses balances is not an atomic operation.
Because there are two instructions, subtracting the balance of the sender
and incrementing the balance of the receiver.
If something bad happens between these two instructions, the final state
will become an invalid state.

For example: \\
\textbf{
bobBalance -= 1 \\
Intermediary State \\
aliceBalance += 1
}

In the account model, it is straight forward to know how much balance each address has.
In the \gls{utxo} model, this calculation is made off-chain. It can be a good thing
because each user has more privacy.

\subsection{Ethereum}

Ethereum differs from Bitcoin in having an \gls{evm} to run script code.
\gls{evm} is a stack machine and Turing complete \cite{turing1936computable} while Bitcoin Script is not
(it is impossible to do loops and recursion in Bitcoin).

Transactions in Bitcoin are all stored in the blockchain.
In Ethereum, just the hash of it is stored in it.
So it is saved in the off-chain database.
Because of that, it is possible to save more information in Ethereum Blockchain.

Contracts in the blockchain are the script program that comes with the transaction.
In Bitcoin, the creator of the contract has to pay the amount proportional to its size.
In Ethereum, it is different.
Each smart contract in Ethereum is made by a series of instructions.
Each instruction consumes different the computational effort.
Because of that, in Ethereum, there is a concept of gas, that measure how much computational effort
each instruction needs.
So in each smart contract, it is well know how much computational effort will be necessary to run it
and it is measured in gas.
Because computational effort of each node in the Ethereum network is a scarce resource,
to execute the smart contract, it is necessary to
pay an amount in ether for each gas to the miner run it.
Smart contracts that pay more ether per gas run first because the miner will want to have the best
profit and they will pick them.
If the amount of ether per gas paid is not high enough, the contract will not be executed,
because some other contracts pay more that will be executed instead of this one.

Because Ethereum has its \gls{evm} with more instructions than Bitcoin and it is Turing Complete,
it is considered less secure.
Ethereum has its high-level programming language called Solidity that looks like JavaScript.
