\subtitle{Abstract}

A cryptocurrency is a digital currency that works in a decentralized way, without a
central authority and its states are maintained through distributed consensus.
It has an important role in society because it is money that is ruled only by algorithms
and it avoids big central power, like banks and government.

Agda is a functional programming language with dependent types.
It is also a proof assistant based on the preposition-as-types paradigm, like Coq.
This language is useful to prove properties about the code.

We present in this work an explanation about what is cryptocurrencies and their principal characteristics,
a brief explanation about Lambda Calculus, dependents types and Agda,
and we present a cryptocurrency model made in this language.
Most of all parts of Bitcoin are coded and typed in this model.
Since transactions, transactions tree, ledger, block, and blockchain.
Cryptographic functions are all postulated like hash functions,
transformation functions of a private key into a public key and addresses.
Besides, in this work, there is code that transforms and validates transactions
from plain text into our model.
