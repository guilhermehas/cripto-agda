\section{Abstract}

We present in this work an explanation about what is cryptocurrencies and their principal characteristics,
a brief explanation about Lambda Calculus, dependents types and Agda,
and we present a cryptocurrency model made in this language.
Most of all parts of Bitcoin are coded and typed in this model.
Since transactions, transactions tree, ledger, block, and blockchain.
Cryptographic functions are all postulated like hash functions,
transformation functions of a private key into a public key and addresses.
Besides, in this work, there is code that transforms and validates transactions
from plain text into our model.
