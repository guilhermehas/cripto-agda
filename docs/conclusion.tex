\section{Conclusion}

This text has shown the definition of Bitcoin protocol.
Definitions of transactions, transactions tree, block, and blockchain.
In this work, it was also made the code that transforms raw transactions in a possible valid transaction,
to incorporate it in the transaction tree.

\subsection{Future work}

In this work, there was a code that transforms a raw transaction into a possible valid transaction.
It is not a decidable function, because there is no definition of what it is an invalid transaction.
From future work, it should have a definition of what is an invalid raw transaction.
So it will avoid that valid transaction will be discarded. 

There is no definition of crypto functions like SHA-256 and elliptic curves in this work.
One thing that can be done is importing these functions from some Agda or Haskell packages.

This work does not have any IO operation.
So it is not possible to add transactions in the blockchain from the command line or the network.

The cryptocurrency of this work does not have any smart contract.
It would be good to define some of them in it.
