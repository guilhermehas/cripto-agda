\subsection{Ledger}

Ledger in the cryptocurrency is like a wallet.
It makes it easier for users to send their coins or to know how much money they have in total.

Here, the definition of how much money the user has in the last tree:

\agda{Ledger}{ledgertree}

The definition of \emph{ledgerOut}:

\agda{Ledger}{ledgerout}

If there is no output, it returns zero of the amount.
If there is at least one output, it verifies if the output address is the same as the address.
If it is, it adds the amount to the amount of the rest of the outputs.
If it is not, it just returns the result of the recursion of the rest of the outputs.

Here, the same code for list of outputs without id:

\agda{Ledger}{ledgernoid}
